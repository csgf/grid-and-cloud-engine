The **Catania Grid & Cloud Engine** is a standard based middleware independent JAVA library that provides several APIs to submit and manage jobs on *Distributed Computer Infrastructures* (DCI). It is compliant with the **Open Grid Forum** (`OGF <https://www.ogf.org/>`_) **Simple API for Grid Applications** (`SAGA <https://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.90.pdf>`_) standard. 

The Catania Grid & Cloud Engine provides a standard way to interact with different DCI middlewares, so the developers can develop their applications without worrying about the details of the infrastructures where those applications will be performed.


The `Figure 1`_ shows the Catania Grid & Cloud Engine architecture, that consists of:

* two interfaces:    
    - **Science GW interface**: towards the applications;
    - **DCI interface**: towards the DCI middlwares based on the SAGA Standard;

* three modules

    - **Job Engine Module**:
    - **Data Engine Module**:
    - **User Track & Monitoring Module**:
